# Project 1 : Lending_Club_Case_Study

Lending Club is a marketplace for loans. This case study is to determine which application is suitable to lend the money so that lending club will minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customer. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

# Project 2 : Bike_Sharing_System 

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
